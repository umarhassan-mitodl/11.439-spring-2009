**Course Introduction: Main Street Sites and Issues Urban Neighborhood Decline: Causes, Consequences, and Challenges**

This class discusses the National Trust for Historic Preservation's (NTHP) Main Streets program model in more detail and introduces the class to the newly created New Orleans Main Street Program and to the St. Claude Avenue Main Streets District.

The class also introduces the problems facing urban commercial districts, the causes and forces behind their decline, and describes some of the economic and physical consequences of their decline.

**New Orleans Background: Social, Political, and Development History**

We will begin the process of building our understanding of the New Orleans context by reviewing readings on the history of New Orleans—emphasizing its political and physical development. An important question for this class is the extent to which pre-Katrina challenges reflect common issues of urban disinvestment and decline or have a unique character given New Orleans' history. We will also explore how the pre-Katrina conditions shape the current rebuilding issues and challenges.

**Urban Design and Development: Ways of Seeing and Listening**

Ways of seeing the built environment will be explored. How do we use maps, visual clues, and other kinds of information to gather information about a place? An overview of techniques for "seeing" the city and using clues to evaluate environments will be discussed during our tour of the St. Claude Avenue Main Streets District. Ways of seeing economic districts will also be presented. Readings are also included on citizen participation in the planning process and the uses of oral history in constructing a vision and plan. Please be sure to do the reading prior to the trip!

**Physical Design and Economic  Planning Tools I Preparation for Field Work**

**Economic Development: Theories of Retail/Identifying Retail Niches Urban Design: Change in Neighborhood Commercial Districts**

We will begin the discussion of physical and economic tools during our walking tour of the St. Claude Avenue Main Streets District and there will be follow-up discussions when we return to Cambridge. During the tour, several urban design and economic development tools will be introduced to the students.

We will provide an overview of the built environment/architecture of neighborhood commercial districts and describe the changes that have occurred to these features during the 20th Century. We will discuss the historic form of these districts, the unsympathetic alterations to them that have occurred in the last fifty years, and some of the efforts that are now being made to restore or complement these features.

In addition, we will discuss economic theories of how retail centers work and how they apply to downtowns and neighborhood commercial districts. We also will discuss the role of niche specialization in business districts and how to identify and evaluate economic and retail niches. Strategies for using urban design and public realm enhancements to revitalize commercial districts will also be explored.

Ethnic retail market analysis ({{% resource_link 64693bde-6849-eff2-ced4-14e44bb855b0 "PDF" %}}) (Courtesy of Prof. Karl Seidman and graduate student. Used with permission.)

Market Analysis is critical to evaluating the economic potential of business districts and identifying which specific retail and service businesses are most likely to be viable in a specific Main Streets district. We will use two market study reports, one for Salem Massachusetts and one for Downtown Detroit to review and assess market analysis approaches. With our focus on developing a food market center in St. Claude, we will also discuss what type of market analysis is needed to better understand the potential, opportunities and barriers for food-related development uses.

This class will also review several frameworks for understanding and evaluating community assets and capacity and discuss how they can be applied to better understand the opportunities and constraints in each neighborhood.

**Early March through April**

Class sessions beginning the second week in March and continuing through April concentrate on the major policies and interventions available to advance revitalization visions. These represent potential plan elements and levers that need to be customized to the local vision, goals and conditions. Readings provide background on these interventions and examples of how communities have applied them. The purpose of each class is to explore how these interventions may apply to the St. Claude Avenue Main Streets District and to develop specific ideas how to incorporate them into a district plan.

**Policies and Interventions I: Development Policies and Interventions II: Design and Zoning Guidelines**

In this class, we will focus on the role of real estate development, both new construction and rehabilitation of existing buildings, in bringing new economic activity to neighborhood Main Street districts. The Central Avenue Corridor Plan for Albany, New York and the Worcester, Massachusetts Arts District Master Plan will provide case studies for this discussion. Key topics will include the role of catalyst projects, overcoming development obstacles, the role of existing building owners, and the merits of new construction versus rehabilitation. This class will also discuss the role of transportation in neighborhood revitalization and approaches to strengthening and leveraging transportation assets for commercial activity and development through the application of transit-oriented development principles.

This class will also discuss the roll of zoning guidelines in shaping development and the reasons for creating design guidelines for a commercial district. We will use examples from the two Boston-area commercial revitalization plans. The class will also review sample design guidelines from various Main Streets programs. Please note that there are quite a few readings for this session. Priority should be given to the first seven readings on the list below. The remaining four readings/reserve materials are supplemental and should be used as needed for your team work on creating overall development strategies and design and zoning frameworks for the districts.

**Synthesis and Reflection**

Synthesis classes are meant as in-class working sessions. Feedback during previous presentation discussions will be used to move projects forward and prepare for the first presentation of assessments and preliminary agendas/proposals to the client. Instructors will offer individual critiques and assistance throughout the class to prepare the students for a team presentation to the client during spring break.

Time will also be devoted to review and reflection on the planning work done to date, particularly the results and implications of the phase 1/existing conditions analysis for the client, project goals and our goals for the next field trip. Need to update the reflection exercise Students will write in their project journals to answer a series of questions regarding their role and the role of team members in the project and in New Orleans. The readings below are meant to guide the students in their reflection.

**Policies and Interventions III: Business Development, Retention, and Attraction Policies and Interventions IV: Marketing and Promotion**

Lecture Slides ({{% resource_link 8112e922-f536-72ea-946d-8003bff739b1 "PDF" %}})

As the economic foundation and key customer destination for commercial district, revitalization programs pay special attention to managing the mix and quality of business. These management efforts encompass two broad activities: (1) retaining and assisting existing businesses; and (2) attracting new enterprises. This class reviews approaches and issues related to achieving a desired mix of businesses and their relevance to the St. Claude Avenue Main Streets District. The Grossman reading, in particular, poses questions about whether new approaches developed to expand markets for micro-enterprises programs can be applied to business districts.

The class will also discuss the need for commercial centers to attract and sustain customer markets for their businesses and the overall district. We will look at the tools and approaches used to develop a district marketing image or position and to directly market the business districts to distinct customer groups.

**Policies and Interventions V: Safety and Sanitation Policies and Interventions VI: Capacity Building and Implementation**

Perceptions on crime and deterioration are a major obstacle to revitalization for many urban commercial districts and providing a safe and clean environment is often a precondition for progress on other revitalization goals. This class reviews approaches that Main Street programs and Business Improvement Districts us to address crime issues and improve the district cleanliness.

Strong organizations and mechanisms to strengthen coordination among key commercial district stakeholders are critical to successful implementation of revitalization plans. This class will look at two formal commercial district coordination mechanisms, Central Retail Management and Business Improvement Districts and review experience with collaborations from broader community development practice. A final part of the class will review and critique the implementation components of the Albany Central Avenue Plan to help provide insight into what constitutes effective implementation planning and proposals.
